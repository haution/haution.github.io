<h3>Content: </h3>
A construction of the Chow group of an algebraic variety will be explained.
This group is defined as the group of algebraic cycles modulo rational
equivalence. Roughly speaking, one considers the free abelian group on closed
subvarieties, and imposes some relations which allow to "move" cycles. This group is used in a variety of settings, including complex geometry, arithmetic geometry, enumerative geometry, commutative algebra, motivic homotopy theory. It may be viewed as a cohomology theory for algebraic varieties, where, for instance, vector bundles have Chern classes. The Chow group of a non-singular variety is equipped with a product, which corresponds to intersecting subvarieties (when they meet correctly).<br/>

The main properties of the Chow group will be discussed in details :
push-forwards, pull-backs, projective bundle theorem, Chern classes, homotopy
invariance, localisation sequence, ring structure. Time permitting, Grothendieck groups of coherent sheaves and the Riemann-Roch theorems will be discussed.
<br/><br/>

Some basic knowledge of algebraic geometry will be assumed (flatness, properness, Cartier divisors,...). I will however adapt to the audience, and recall the required notions if necessary.<br/><br/>
