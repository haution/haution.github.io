<h3>Description</h3>
The main objects of study will be central simple algebras over a field. Examples of such (noncommutative) algebras are quaternions and matrix algebras. These algebras are described by the so-called Brauer group of the field, and play an important role in number theory and algebraic geometry. The course will include an introduction to the theory of torsors, and a self-contained presentation of the theory of cohomology of (profinite) groups.<br/>

The methods used will be varied, and range from a classical approach to noncommutative algebra via the theory of simple rings, to a description of torsors in terms of explicit cocyles, to the homological methods of group cohomology.
<br/><br/>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
Basic knowledge of Galois theory will be assumed. The required notions of homological algebra concerning group cohomology will be introduced during the course. No knowledge of algebraic geometry will be required.
<br/><br/>

<h3>Audience</h3>
Students of the Master program in Mathematics.<br/><br/>
